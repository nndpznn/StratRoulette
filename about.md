## Components

### Provide a title for your overall project (it doesn’t have to be the app’s name, but it should certainly describe it)
- We called our app "**StratRoulette**", a combination of the common shortening of "strategy", and "roulette" to reflect the random gamble you take on when using the app.

### Explain your user audience and their needs
-	Our audience is gamers who look for ways to make their favorite video game titles more fun. Due to the repetitive nature of most games, losing the joyful spark you get from them is inevitable. We allow our users to break out of the same game loop, by using community-sourced challenge ideas to enhance their and their friends' experiences.

### Provide screenshots of your app, with captions/commentary as appropriate
