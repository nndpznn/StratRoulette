# IDEATION! from the Button Pressers (due 4/10)


## Guiding Questions

### Which audiences did you consider, and which one did you settle on for your app?
We considered college students, gamers, Destiny 2 players, Logic and Computer Design students, and Den-goers. We settled on gamers for now.

### List the ten needs that you identified for your chosen audience.

1. New achivements for games that don't update their achievements
2. Exercise/nutrition(stereotype)
3. Finding better communities/LFG
4. Better time management skills/life balancing
5. Easy way to figure out what the META is/tracking nerfs and buffs
6. An easy way to get caught up on recent updates/game news
7. A way to get started in content creation/streaming
8. IRL meetups/IRL friends
9. A way to find advice on gear/PC setups
10. A way to keep track of ESports teams and scores

### State the three needs that were chosen out of the ten, and state the projects that you mapped to those needs.

1. Exercise for Gamers
Solution: An app to combine gaming time with exercise time for a positive feedback loop.

2. Keeping track of the META
Solution: A user-sourced app that allows users to catch up new and returning players on recent events and changes.

3. A cure for boredom while gaming all the time.
Solution: An app that encourages switching up the usual tactics/activities and trying something fresh.


### For each of the three projects, list the goals/ideas that you brainstormed for them.

1. Exercise for Gamers
An exercise app that receives information on your performance in-game, and recommends exercises for you to do after. 
People can put in their own algorithms of varying difficulty, and users can decide which to use and save.

2. Keeping track of the META
An app where users can stay up-to-date on the latest balancing changes and META. User submitted posts? Using the Destiny API?
- PROBLEM: This may just devolve into social media. There's no clear way to know what the META is, and there may not be a strong structure to the app as a result.

3. Community Based Strat Roulette
Users will be able to roll the dice and subject their team to various challenges and self-imposed "modifiers".  To compromise with idea 1, we decicded that some element of exercise could easily be integrated into the challanges or modifiers.
- Possible extra goals:
    - Static community achievements (aside from roulette challenges)
    - Support for multiple games
- API USAGE: TBD - Possibly Steam API(?) or Bungie API(?)
- AUTH/PROFILE USAGE: Submit your own challenges and create your own lists of challenges to roll with.


### State the “winner” of this process.

WINNER: COMMUNITY BASED STRAT ROULETTE!
