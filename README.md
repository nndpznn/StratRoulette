## Welcome to StratRoulette!
Do you ever get bored of the same old shtick? Do you boot up your favorite video game only to realize you have nothing to do (looking at you, Destiny 2 players)? Our app is catered to players who are looking for something new.

Users can view user-submitted challenges, which are entertaining self-imposed modifiers and goals to spice up gameplay. When logged in(via Google Auth), users can not only view but create their own challenges and assemble playlists to collect their favorites. Using playlists, users can click "shuffle" to randomly select a challenge for them to complete. User profiles will display created challenges as well as playlists.
