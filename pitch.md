## Guiding Questions

 - ### State the final inspiration statement that you crafted for your chosen audience
	 - Do you ever get bored of the same old shtick? Do you boot up your favorite video game only to realize you have nothing to do (looking at you, Destiny 2 players)? Our app is catered to players who are looking for something new.

 - ### State the possible solutions from preliminary ideation that you considered
	 - Offer the app users a random challenge from collections of user-sourced ideas, or an achievement, based on the chosen game's community's feedback.
	 - In tandem with the games the majority of players are interested in, offer the users real-life fitness and wellbeing challenges that correspond to in-game events.

 - ### State the final app idea that your team has decided to do
	 - In our app, users will be able to view user-sourced "Challenges", which are entertaining self-imposed modifiers and goals to spice up gameplay. When logged in, users can not only view but create their own Challenges and assemble "Playlists" to collect their favorites. Using Playlists, users can click "Shuffle" to randomly select a Challenge for them to complete.
	 - User profiles will display created challenges as well as playlists.
