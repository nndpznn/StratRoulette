## Guiding Questions

 - ### State the final inspiration statement that you crafted for your chosen audience
	 - You ever get bored of the same old shtick? Do you boot up your favorite video game only to realize you have nothing to do (looking at you, Destiny 2 players)? Our app is catered to players that are looking for something new.
 - ### State the possible solutions from preliminary ideation that you considered
	 - Offer the app users a randomly generated challenge, or an achievement, that is based on the chosen game's community's feedback.
	 - In tandem with the game studios majority of players have an interest in, offer the userbase real life fitness and wellbeing challenges that correspond to in-game benefits (because gamers simply have to make it chronically online).
 - ### State the final app idea that your team has decided to do
	 - The users will create an account in order to use our app. We grant the users a custom profile where they can view their saved (or created) challenges, redeem their rewards, and create compilations of stategies for other users to view. The user can also fetch a random challenge, categorized into different difficulty levels, for their favorite games to spice up their nightly gaming session.
